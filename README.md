# CS 741 Project
Semester long project for CS 741: Software Engineering Principles

## Stack
- Front end: Angular
- Back end/API: Node/Express
- Database: Cloud Firestore

## Objective
To develop a software system for a non-profit organization that is used to do the book keeping for their participants.

## Problem Description
A non-profit organization needs to keep a record of the participants in relates to various events and programs. The participants include the donor, the volunteer and the others. The following are the requirements and assumptions for this problem:
- The non-profit organization operates in the way of event driven through out the year.
- There are four types of users for this system –Administrator, Donor, Volunteerand Other. First three types of user must have an account to login into the system.
- The others can view the various events and programs hosted in this organization, and can choose to create an account to become a donor or volunteer.
- An administrator can create and maintain (modify and/or delete) the accounts for everybody  in  the  system  including  other  administrators.  All  administrators  will have equal privileges.
- The administer will be able to do some simple data analysis and reports. (Example: the total amount of a donor’s contribution to the organization in year 2020)
- The donor will be able to make restricted donation to a certain event/program or unrestricted donation. The donor can also simple attend an event without make any contribution.
- The volunteer can register to help an event at certain time slot or help program activities.•An event can be associated with zero, one or more programs.
- An event can be associated with zero, one or more programs.

## Minimal Functionalites
- Provisions  to  add,  search,  remove,  modify,  and  view  different  types  of  users except “the others”.
- Provisions to add, search, remove, modify, and view an event or program.
- GUI interface in a web or mobile application
- Database associated for persistence of data
